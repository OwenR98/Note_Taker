# Note_Taker

The Note taking application designed during exploring windows.forms in c# using .net. It's like javax.swing but not terrible!

The broad goal with this small item was to familiarise myself with some c# technology which I have not yet used.

The program allows the user to write text like in Microsoft notepad, and then save this as a .txt file in whatever directory they choose.
